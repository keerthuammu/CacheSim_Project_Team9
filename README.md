# FIFO Cache Module
## Description
This branch contains the FIFO (First-In First-Out) cache replacement algorithm.
FIFO (First-In First-Out) is a simple cache replacement method where the block that enters the cache first is the one that gets removed first when the cache is full. It works like a queue, without checking how often or how recently the data is used. Because of its simplicity, FIFO is easy to understand and commonly used to explain basic cache memory concepts.
