ALGORITHM:

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read the cache size
Step 3: Read the sequence of memory block references
Step 4: Initialize
      •	an empty cache
      •	frequency count for each block
      •	hit = 0, miss = 0
Step 5: For each memory reference
      •	If the block is already in cache
              o	Increment hit count
              o	Increase frequency of the block
      •	Else
              o	Increment miss count
              o	If cache is not full
      	Insert the block into cache
              o	Else
                   Remove the block with the least frequency (LFU)
                   Insert the new block
              o	Update frequency
Step 6: Display cache contents after each reference
Step 7: Calculate hit ratio = hits / total references
Step 8: Stop
