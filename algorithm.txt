Step 1: Initialize an empty cache
Step 2: Read cache size and memory reference sequence
Step 3: For each memory reference:
  • If reference exists in cache → Hit
  • Remove it and reinsert at most-recent position
  • Else → Miss
  • If cache is full → remove least recently used element
  • Insert new reference
Step 4: Display cache contents after each step
Step 5: Calculate total hits, misses, and hit ratio
