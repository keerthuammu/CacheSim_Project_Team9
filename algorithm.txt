Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read Cache Configuration
Read:
•	Number of cache sets (NUM_SETS)
•	Associativity (number of cache lines per set)
•	Cache replacement policy (LRU / FIFO / RANDOM)
Step 3: Initialize Cache Structure
•	Create an empty cache with NUM_SETS sets.
•	Each set can hold up to ASSOCIATIVITY blocks.
•	If policy is FIFO, initialize a FIFO queue for each set.
Step 4: Initialize Counters
•	Set hit counter = 0
•	Set miss counter = 0
Step 5: Read Memory Block Reference Sequence
Read the list of memory block references to be accessed.
Step 6: For Each Memory Block, Perform the Following:
Step 6.1: Determine Block Number and Tag
•	Treat the memory reference as the block number.
•	Compute tag using:
tag = block_number / number_of_sets
Step 6.2: Compute Set Index
•	Calculate set index using:
set_index = block_number mod number_of_sets
Step 6.3: Select Cache Set
•	Access the cache set corresponding to the computed set index.
Step 6.4: Search for Block in Cache Set
•	Check whether the block already exists in the selected set.
Step 6.5: If Block is Found (Cache Hit)
•	Increment hit counter.
•	If replacement policy is LRU, move the accessed block to the most recently used position.
•	Return HIT.
Step 6.6: If Block is Not Found (Cache Miss)
•	Increment miss counter.
•	Create a new block entry with block number and tag.
Step 6.7: If Free Space Exists in the Set
•	Insert the new block into the cache set.
•	If policy is FIFO, update the FIFO queue.
Step 6.8: If Cache Set is Full
•	Select a victim block based on the replacement policy:
o	LRU: Remove the least recently used block.
o	FIFO: Remove the block that entered first using FIFO queue.
o	RANDOM: Remove a randomly selected block.
•	Insert the new block into the cache set.
Step 7: Display Cache State (Optional After Accesses)
•	Display all cache sets showing block number and tag order.
Step 8: Repeat
Repeat Step 6 for all memory block references.
Step 9: Calculate Performance Metrics
•	Total accesses = hits + misses
•	Hit ratio = hits / (hits + misses)
Step 10: Display Final Results
•	Display total hits
•	Display total misses
•	Display hit ratio
Step 11: Stop
